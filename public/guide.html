        <p>
          As with driving a car (see Car &amp;amp; Jeep Rental), motorcycle and
          mopeds can be especially dangerous in Jamaica. Nevertheless many
          tourists find this an exciting, interesting and cost effective way to
          explore the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rentals cost between $45 and $85 per day, depending on the company,
          the season, and the size and type of bike. Companies we regularly use
          include:
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          If you use any other companies make sure they are licensed.  Your bike
          should have a valid fitness transfer and registration, valid
          insurance, two license plates, functioning lights (we recommend
          keeping them turned on while riding even in the daytime), brakes and
          horn.  It is recommended that you wear a helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bicycles can be rented for about US$10 to US$15 per day or US$70 to
          US$100 per week from Banmark (contact details above). Check that the
          bike is functioning properly before leaving - particularly the brakes.
          We recommend wearing a helmet.  See also the

          There are various rental companies that can be arranged directly,
          through the Front Desk at Skylark, or on arrival at Montego Bay
          airport. In high season it is advisable to book in advance.

        <p>
          All of these companies can arrange for cars to meet you at the hotel
          or at the airport for pick up and drop off. Prices depend on the
          company you choose; the size and type of vehicle; air-conditioning;
          the season; where you are picking up and dropping off and whether
          insurance is covered by your credit card.  Rates range from US$80 to
          US$100 per day and US$250 to US$500 per week (excluding insurance). 
          You will need to be at least 21, have a valid driver’s license and a
          recognized credit card.

          Renting a car can be an intriguing experience as you learn to
          negotiate Jamaica’s roads.  Potholes, goats, children, vendors, other
          vehicles and an unbelievable variety of Jamaican life and culture
          finds its way into the street and you, as a driver, must not only get
          where you want to go, but avoid all the obstacles.  And most
          importantly remember to stay on the left!  Roads are largely unmarked
          and the few signs may be difficult to locate or read. This can
          especially make driving at night, without knowledge of the road,
          dangerous.  Still, a rental car gives you the freedom to go where you
          want to go. If you get lost, Jamaican’s are always forthcoming with
          directions, which may or may not be precisely correct, but will be
          sure to be part of your Jamaican adventure.

        <p>
          Being in a natural environment, there are a number of creatures
          (mostly harmless) that also inhabit our locale. Some of the more
          bothersome are:
        </p>
        <div
          style="
            width: 100%;
            display: grid;

            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
          "
        >
          <div>
            <p>
              <em>Jelly Fish (Stingers)</em> - At certain times of the year
              there are stingers in the sea water. They are translucent bodies
              that float near the surface of the water. Usually observable
              through a facemask, they can be avoided relatively easily. If
              stung you should abort the dive, do not rub to prevent further
              discharge, wash the affected area with an antiseptic, and apply
              vinegar or rubbing alcohol to the skin immediately. Where allergic
              reaction occurs, treat the stung area with cortisone and if your
              condition deteriorates seek medical advice. Severe stings,
              especially in the face and throat area may cause breathing
              difficulty and shock in susceptible divers. If this occurs,
              immediately notify the Front Desk or the General Manager to seek
              immediate medical attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Fire Coral</em> - On nearly every reef you can find fire
              coral. Fire coral is also potentially found on the ropes used to
              secure the bouys on our swim line and for this reason we do not
              recommend touching the ropes or buoys. Creamy tan in color , it
              comes in a variety of shapes because it can grow other coral, for
              example sea fans, it is not always easy to distinguish. Upon
              contact, nematocyst, small stinging cells located on the polyps
              will discharge causing a burning sensation. Rubbing the area will
              only induce further discharge, making it worse. After the dive
              apply some meat tenderizer to reduce the sting. An antibiotic or
              cortisone cream might be beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em> Fire or Bristle worms</em> - This worm, resembling a large
              centipede, can be seen crawling through the reef, feeding on
              polyps of stag horn coral and soft gorgonians. Don’t play with
              them; the bristles of white hair, that become visible when the
              worm is disturbed, will penetrate your skin and are nearly
              impossible to remove. They will cause an irritation that can last
              a few days and is quite painful. Cortisone cream may help to ease
              the pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Stingrays</em> - Although southern and yellow stingrays are
              able to cause a potential serious injury with their venomous spine
              located at the base of the tail, they will not seek you out to do
              so. If stung seek medical attention as soon as possible, but if
              there is a time delay, it helps to keep the injured area submerged
              in water as hot as you can tolerate. This will assist in breaking
              down the protein-based venom and alleviates the pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em> Barracudas</em> - Although their appearance is intimidating,
              they are not really dangerous animals. Because they need to pump
              water through their gills to breath, they are often seen with
              their mouths open, displaying a fierce set of teeth. However,
              these are normally not used on humans, providing you follow the
              basic rule of leaving them alone. In standoff situations where a

              <em> Mosquitoes</em> - At certain times of the year mosquitoes can
              be numerous in the West End of Negril. In undertaking the
              re-landscaping of the garden we paid particular attention to this
              problem, eradicating plants where pools of water formed in the
              leaves creating an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes. Also, in
              renovating the rooms we replaced all of the fly wire, built
              additional screens and put mosquito nets on each bed. In addition,
              we regularly spray the rooms and grounds for bugs. The measures
              outlined, combined with a few simple steps can ensure peaceful
              nights:

              <em>Sea Urchins (Sea Spikes)</em> - These are black round spiny
              creatures that are observable submerged, clinging to rocks and the
              sea floor. If touched their spines will spike you and break off
              under your skin. Most often such encounters occur by stepping on
              the urchin while getting into and out of the water across the
              rocks. They are usually not on the metal ladders and so this is
              the safest way to access the water. If stung the spines should be
              removed with tweezers. <br />
              <br />
              Local tradition is to soak the stung area in urine (your own or
              your partners will work!). The acid helps bring any submerged
              spine to the surface and relieve the pain. For those a little less
              adventurous you may alternatively soak the area in vinegar,
              ammonia or an antiseptic to assist the body in dissolving them.
              Our spa team will be happy to assist with soaking the injured area
              in vinegar. Afterwards an antibiotic cream can be applied. In a
              serious case or if infection occurs, a doctor should be consulted.
              There is no permanent damage from such a sting, although it may
              remain tender and somewhat numb in the area for a few days while
              the poison from the sting clears.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em> Hydroids</em> - There are a variety of hydroids on the reef,
              all causing a mild to moderate sting when touched. They can be
              found at any depth, but the most common place where divers
              encounter them is on mooring lines. Because hydroids belong to the
              same class as fire coral, first aid for stings is the same:
              application of meat tenderizer and cortisone cream.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Sponges</em> - Some of the beautiful colored sponges can also
              produce a mild sting, but if you follow the “hands off” rule, that
              type of injury is rare. Vinegar can be used as first aid, followed
              with a cortisone cream.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Scorpion fish</em> - Sometimes they are called stonefish or,
              by Jamaicans, “poisonous grouper.” Like the rays, these fish have
              spines containing venom, which is used as a defense against
              possible attackers. Scorpion fish are experts in camouflage and
              blend in very well with their background. They tend to lie
              motionless unless seriously harassed, after which they will
              quickly move away. If by chance, you get stung, first aid and
              treatment is the same as mentioned above for stingray’s punctures.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em> Pacific Lionfish</em> - The lionfish is a voracious predator
              which eats only other fish and occasionally young lobster. They
              originate in the Pacific and Indian oceans but have found an ideal
              home in the warm waters of the Caribbean and can grow between six
              and 18 inches. The fish are often used as ornamental fish because
              of their colourful bodies and long separated spines, and are,
              therefore, often placed in aquariums for attraction. Depending on
              their species, the fish can appear yellow, brown, red, orange,
              black, maroon or white. The fish confuses and traps its predators
              (other fish) by extending its long spines and moving closely
              towards it. Before the prey can escape, it charges and gobbles it
              in a split second. The fish can also be dangerous to humans as its
              spines contain toxins that produce a sharp pain upon contact.
              These are treatable with a tetanus shot but it is advised that if
              you see these fish that you stay away from them and advise the
              front desk of the area in which they are seen.

            As soon as the sun starts going down ensure that all the doors to
            the room are kept closed - be sure to check the door to the shower.

            At the same time lower the mosquito net and tuck it into the sides
            of the bed.

            Ensure that lights are not left on in the rooms in the evening as

            Use an insect repellent such “OFF”, available in our Boutique. A
            natural remedy is to rub the juices from a freshly-cut lime
            (available at the bar) on your skin.

            Ensure that you sleep with your mosquito net tucked into the bed.
            Tuck the ends in prior to entering and the sides can be gathered and
            tucked in once inside – note the net drops inside the posts.

          <li>
            For those of you wishing to take more radical action, in addition to
            the above steps, light a coil on the floor by the bed about a half
            an hour before the sun starts to go down and let it burn throughout
            the night. Coils are available at the Skylark Boutique. To protect
            the floor please put the coil on the coil dish, which should be in
            your room.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Housekeeping will hook the nets over the top of the bedposts to put it
          up during the day. To put it down, the nets are lifted back over the
          post, while keeping the elastic attachment on the post.

          <em>Others</em> - There are obviously a host of other creatures that
          inhabit the air, land and sea at Skylark Negril. If any of them are
          bothersome please notify the Front Desk.

          The local currency, the Jamaican Dollar, is represented as J$ and
          pronounced the “Jay”. It is a free floating exchange rate, however,
          over the past five years it has been weakening at a rate about 10%
          each year. Of course fluctuations are unpredictable and may occur at
          any time. You can exchange your US dollars at the Front Desk; and US
          dollars is readily accepted everywhere. See Foreign Exchange for more

          Customs &amp; Departure
        </h3>
        <p>
          We recommend that you reconfirm your flight on the morning of your
          departure and check if it is scheduled on time. It is often best to
          ask if the incoming plane departed on time and is scheduled to arrive
          on time. Allow 90 minutes to travel by taxi to the airport in Montego
          Bay and you should be at the airport two hours prior to departure -
          the lines can be very long, particularly for departure! Additionally,
          there are at times very long lines going through Customs which may
          cause a delay to your departure gate making it very important to
          arrive to the airport at least two hours in advance.
